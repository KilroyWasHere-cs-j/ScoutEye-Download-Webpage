# ScoutEye configuration

As promised, ScoutEye is highly configurable. This page will explain how to configure ScoutEye.

Both ScoutEye Desktop and ScoutEye Universal are configured using the same .xml file. However, the method of exposing ScoutEye to the configuration file is different.

For ScoutEye Desktop, the configuration file is located in the same directory as the ScoutEye executable.

The file is called SettingsProfessional.xml or SettingsAmateur.xml depending on which level you are configuring.

Whilst it is possible to edit the file directly, it is recommended to use the ScoutEye configuration tool.


## ScoutEye configuration tool

The ScoutEye configuration tool is a tool that allows you to configure ScoutEye without having to edit the .xml file directly. It is recommended to use this tool to configure ScoutEye. It's designed to be simple and easy to use. Below we will explain how to use the tool.

Before the tool can be used it is best to have an understanding of the two levels that ScoutEye supports. The two levels are **Professional** and **Amateur**. Please read the docs covering this information for details on the two-level system.
